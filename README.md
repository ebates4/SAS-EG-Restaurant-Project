# SAS-EG-Restaurant-Project
This SAS project analyzed 2012 Mexico restaurant data to provide insights for both restaurants and customers.

Our objectives were:

- Identify the top rated restaurants by assessing their service ratings, food quality ratings, and overall ratings.
- Analyze different restaurant features (cuisines, price, dress code, etc.) for restaurants fulfilling certain rating conditions (top 10, average rating > 1.75 etc).
- Provide tailored recommendations for customers given their budget and preferences.
